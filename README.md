# exercise

This project contains a small programming exercise for new Java developers.

The exercise is fairly simple. Create an implementation of the PersonRepoInterface repository and write the corresponding tests. It is not necessary to actually have a database underneath the repo. If the entities are stored in some in memory structure (list, map, etc) thats absolutely fine.

The solution will serve as a talking point at an interview. Here the focus will be on the style of the code, how the different methods have been implemented and the quality of the tests.

When solving the exercise, please fork this repo into your own public repo, which you can then share with the owner of this repo. Remember to commit all changes to the forked repo.
